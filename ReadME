*********************Group 5 Project Assignment****************
***Please communicate effectively with another team members if you have an issue with the code or need more explanation.

**************ONE**************
Class ProcessFile:
Create a read file method "read_file(self, file):".
Using the read_file method, this class will read the content of the Inaugural Speech text file and return it as a string.
You might want to print it out in the console to ensure your code works.

Class StringAnalyzer:
Create an extract next word method "extract_next_word(self, text):".
Using extract_next_word, this class will extract the given string for the next word after the word 'the' from the returned string from ProcessFile.
You might want to print it out in the console to ensure your code works.

**************TWO**************
Class FileWriter:
Create:
"def __init__(self):"
    To create a list.

"def add_to_list(self, word):"
    To append the words to the list.

"def write_to_file(self, file_path):"
    To write to a new file.

This class will add the extracted words from StringAnalyzer to a list and then write the list to a file.


**************THREE**************
Main Method:
In the Main Method:
1) Create instances of the classes.
2) Use the instance of the ProcessFile() to call the read_file method and pass in the argument 'inaugural_speech.txt'.
3) Use the StringAnalyzer() instance to call the extract_next_word method and pass in the step 2 variable.
4) Use the FileWriter() instance to call
    i) add_to_list and pass in the argument variable from step 3.
    ii) write_to_file and pass in the new file name where the extracted words will be written.
